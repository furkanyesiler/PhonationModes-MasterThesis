## Feature Extraction

Feature extraction part of our experiments are done by utilizing 4 different toolboxes. Here, we give the links for each toolbox and share the required scripts in order to extract the features from given audio files.

Detailed information about the feature space used in our experiments can be found in Section 2.3 of the thesis.

### RASTAMAT

This toolbox can be found [here](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/matlab/rastamat/)

The Matlab script required to extract the MFCC, RASTA-PLP and PLP features by using this toolbox is shared as [rastamat_script.m](https://github.com/furkanyesiler/PhonationModes/blob/master/thesis-proposedmethod/feature_extraction/rastamat_script.m)

### MIRToolbox

This toolbox can be found [here](https://www.jyu.fi/hytk/fi/laitokset/mutku/en/research/materials/mirtoolbox)

The Matlab script required to extract the Temporal Flatness, Spectral Flatness and Spectral Flux features by using this toolbox is shared as [mirtoolbox_script.m](https://github.com/furkanyesiler/PhonationModes/blob/master/thesis-proposedmethod/feature_extraction/mirtoolbox_script.m)

### Praat
