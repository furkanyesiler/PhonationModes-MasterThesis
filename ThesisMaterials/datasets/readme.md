## Datasets

#### Our experiments use 4 individual datasets and a combined one. More information regarding datasets can be found in Section 2.1 of the thesis.

### DS-1

DS-1 can be downloaded from https://osf.io/cwquj/ .

### DS-2

DS-2 is made freely available upon request by the authors of the following work:

### DS-3 and DS-4

DS-3 and DS-4 are also made freely available upon request. You can get in contact with [Furkan Yesiler](mailto:furkan.yesiler@gmail.com) or [Rafael Ramirez](mailto:rafael.ramirez@upf.edu) for both datasets.

### DS-C

DS-C is the combined dataset consisting recordings from DS-2, DS-3 and DS-4.

### Balanced Datasets

For our experiments, we have created balanced versions of each dataset in terms of the number of recordings for each phonation mode. In [Balanced_Datasets.ods](https://github.com/furkanyesiler/PhonationModes-MasterThesis/blob/master/ThesisMaterials/datasets/Balanced_Datasets.ods), we share the recordings we used for our experiments, and the recordings we left out while creating the balanced datasets.
